 3. Download Zarchiver if you don't have. Zarchiver allows you to modified zip file without extracting it

 - Android 7.1.2 64bit, `init.rc` is in `tool_init/7.1_64`
 - Android 7.1.2 32bit, `init.rc` is in `tool_init/7.1`
 - Android 5.1.1, `init.rc` is in `tool_init/5.1`

### **Mount real storage**
Your real device storage can be mounted to `/sdcard/real_storage` or `/local_disk` in VMOS Pro. Access your files in real phone storage (internal and external storage) from virtual machine. Note: Read-write external storage at `/sdcard/real_storage/storage/<sdcard_name>/Android/data/com.vmos.pro/`

### **Use external SD Card as VM storage**
Expand your VM storage by using the memory card capacity as the virtual machine's `/sdcard` internal memory.

## VMOS Tool modification zip (v1.8+)

### About

Because VMOS Pro doesn't have Recovery mode, Modification zip is alternative way of flashable recovery zip which allows you to apply changes into system as you want. Example: Change boot animation, remove some app, change system user interface,...

You are recommended to make a modification zip instead of making custom ROM because it can import everything you need to add or remove into ROM.


### Create mods


1. Download template here: [template_toolflash_mod.zip](https://github.com/HuskyDG/VMOSPro_RootXposed_Terminal/blob/main/template_toolflash_mod.zip?raw=true)

2. Extract template file.

3. Place your files that you want to replace in `/system` in `system` folder.

4. `config.sh` (must have) is a script which is executed before `/system` is being writed.

Configure variables in `config.sh`:

```
# List folders and files here if you want to remove, this will overwrite values above!
REMOVE_LIST="

"

# == IGNORE PLACE ==
# Set to true of you don't want place any file into /system

IGNORE_PLACE=false

# == SCRIPT ==

# Input your post-fs-data script name here

POSTFSDATA=<your_post-fs-data_script_name>.sh 

# Input your late_start script name here

LATESTART=<your_late_start_script_name>.sh

# Set to true if you want to apply changes (replace or remove some files /system) only after boot 

# From Terminal Tool v1.20 and above, APPLY_ON_BOOT is always actived even you set to false

APPLY_ON_BOOT=true

### YOUR SCRIPT
# Write your script here ...
echo "- Mod by HuskyDG"

```

5. `custom.sh` is a script which is executed after `config.sh`.

6. Finally, compress all files and folders into a zip file. Now you have a Modification zip, you can flash it to apply your changes into any virtual machine.

### How to install a module?

No need to extract zip file to `/sdcard/toolflash/` anymore!

1. Need VMOS Pro Terminal Tool v1.15+

v1.18 add **Flash a zip by path**

2. **Flash all zip in /sdcard/toolflash** Place your mod `.zip` file at `/sdcard/toolflash/`, open Terminal app, type `tool` command then `6` (Enter) and `1` (Enter) to install mods.

3. **Flash a zip by path** Open Terminal app, type `tool` command then `6` (Enter) and `2` (Enter) then type your zip path (Example: `/sdcard/Download/mymod.zip`)

4. **Flash a zip by call command**

```
generic:/ $ . utils
generic:/ $ install_mod path/to/zip
```
